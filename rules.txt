1. You must use all of the provided HTML/CSS for each exercise as part of your solution.

2. DO NOT edit the HTML for any of the exercises (except the 4th one, which asks you to write your own).

3. Submit both your uncompiled .scss file and the compiled .css file for all exercises.

4. Solutions need to work ONLY in the newest version of Chrome.

5. For all exercises:
    - start.png is an image of what index.html will look like in the browser before any of your modifications
    - end.png is an image of what index.html should look like in the browser after you're finished
    - You'll need to compile the style.scss file provided before index.html will look like start.png

6. Please indicate in your .scss file, using comments, which pieces of your CSS are the answer to which question (if applicable, some questions only have 1 part).

  Example:
  
  // code for #1
  
  div {
    color: red;
  }
  
  // code for #2
  
  ul {
    list-style: none;
  }

7. Nested selectors in SCSS count as 1 selector.

  Example:
  
  .one {
     div {
      a {
        color: black;
      }
    }
  }
  
  Counts as 1 CSS selector, because it compiles to: .one div a { color: black; }

8. Keep nested selectors as clean as possible within the context of the given HTML.

  Example:
  
  <div class="example">
    <ul>
      <li><a href="#">Link 1</a></li>
      <li><a href="#">Link 2</a></li>
      <li><a href="#">Link 3</a></li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  
  .example {
    ul {
      li {
        a {
          color: red;
        }
      }
    }
  }
  
  That style is unnecessarily specific. Assuming that HTML is the complete page HTML, it should be:
  
  a {
    color: red;
  }
