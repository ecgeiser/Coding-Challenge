For this question, edit ONLY the ready.js file.

Create the functionality shown in end.mov using jQuery (watch the scroll bar).

Functionality:
  - Click a link in the navigation bar
  - Page scrolls such that the corresponding section of the site fills the browser window
  
Requirements:
  - ready.js should be 15 LINES OF CODE OR LESS in total.
  - Bonus points if you can keep it under 10 lines total.
  - Use normal line breaking. For example, declaring a variable should have a line to itself.
