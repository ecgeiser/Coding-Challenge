For this exercise, you need to write a typewriter in javascript/jquery. Basically every X amount of seconds, it types out a letter onto the DOM.


1. 
Given an input word, break it down in to smaller pieces (characters), then every x amount of time, keep appending a character one by one to the span.typewriter-text. For timing between characters, use the delay variable. So the effect looks like someone is typing something out. Write all of your code in the writeText function.

Bonus
For the bonus, create a function that given an array of words, does the same above for each individual array element, but with a delay between each element. So it looks likeSo for example given an array of words ['Brave', 'Smart'], a function would take each element individually, break them into smaller pieces, and type them out with a small delay. Write all of your code in the writeWords function.



You shouldn't need to add any styles, but if for some reason you do, run sass style.scss:style.css --watch in the terminal.
